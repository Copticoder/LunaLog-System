A Mobile Application Made For The Global Nasa Space Apps Challenge. Specifically, Nasa Space Apps Mansoura Challenge. This mobile application is a part of a whole system that solves the challenge: Lunar Surface Operations: Real-Time Collaboration. The Application enables people on earth to see logs of astronauts at the time of the mission. Astronauts log by text, voice, image, and video where NLP and Computer Vision are used to analyze the log and classify it based on the event type. Astronauts will be able to fork other astronautsâ€™ logs into their profile in the mobile application and approve their logs by the end of the mission. ATM the application provides the ability to login to the dashboard where the user can see other users logs and his log. MVC design pattern is implemented in the mobile app. More features to be added..
